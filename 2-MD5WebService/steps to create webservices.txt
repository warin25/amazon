1. Creating the web service
Now let’s create our web service class. The web service method returns a MD5-hahsed value of an input string.
Using the annotations @WebService for the class and @WebMethod for the service method.

With help of the annotations, the web service class looks like just a normal Java class.

Type the following command to compile the web service class (suppose the current directory is parent of the 
directory structure for the package: vce.webservices.server):

javac -d . MD5WebService.java

2.Creating the server program
The JAX-WS implementation will create necessary infrastructure to start the server using some default configuration. 
And once started, the server is ready to receiving client’s requests.

Type the following command to compile the server class:

javac -d . WebServiceServer.java
Start the server program using the following command:                                                               

java vce.webservices.server.WebServiceServer
We should see the server started and is waiting for client’s requests at the command prompt.

3.
Open a web browser and type the following URI into its address bar:

http://localhost:9898/md5WebService?wsdl
The browser will receive an XML document that describes the web service

4.Creating the client program
Before writing code for the client program, we have to generate some metadata code for the web service, 
by using the wsimporttool. This tool imports metadata about a web service provided by a URI and generates 
Java source files required for a web service client. Syntax of the wsimport command is as follows:

                         wsimport [options] <WSDL_URI>

Where:

options: specifies some options when generating the client code. You can type only wsimportin the command prompt 
to see a list of options.
WSDL_URI: specifies a URI that describes the web service.
Open another command prompt and change the current directory to the parent directory of vce\webservices. 
Type the following command:

 

wsimport -keep -p vce.webservices.client http://localhost:9898/md5WebService?wsdl


Based on the information obtained from the web service, the wsimport tool generates the following classes 
(both .java and .class files) and put them under package net.codejava.webservices.client:

package-info.java
ObjectFactory.java
MD5WebServiceService.java
MD5WebService.java
HashStringResponse.java
HashString.java

5.

This client program invokes the web service method hashString() and passes “admin” as an argument, 
and it will display the result received from web service server to the console. 
Type the following command to compile the web service client class:

javac -d . WebServiceClient.java
And type this command to run the client program:

java vce.webservices.client.WebServiceClient
The client connects to the server, invokes the remote method and receives the result
